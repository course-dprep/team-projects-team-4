# Title of your Project: The role of film length and audience scores

*(Describe the purpose of this project)*

The goal of this project is to examine the relationship between movie running time and audience ratings, 
and how this relationship may differ between a selection of movie genres. 


## Motivation
*Provide background/motivation for your project*

*Mention your research question*

The movie industry continuously tries to understand what factors influence audience ratings, as they play a
very important role in determining commercial success and popularity. One characteristic that might impact
viewer’s perceptions is running time. Longer films can allow for more extensive storytelling and character
development, however they may also demand higher mental effort and time commitment from the audience.
As a consequence, the relationship between running time and audience ratings remains unclear and worth
looking into.

Furthermore, audience expectations on time might differ between movie genres. For instance, viewers might
expect longer runtimes in genres like drama, considering the complexity of the storyline, whereas fast paced
runtimes might be expected for low cognitive effort genres, such as comedies. Considering this, the effect of
runtime on ratings in most likely not uniform, and it might depend on viewing preferences.

<br>

**Based on this, the main research question that will be examined is described as:**

*- What is the relationship between running time (IV) and audience ratings (DV) in movies, and how does this differ between movie genres?*


## Data

*What dataset(s) did you use? How was it obtained?*

To examine the research question, two publicly available datasets from the IMBD website
were utilized.

The data sets used:  
- https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz  
- https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.ratings.tsv.gz  

<br>

*How many observations are there in the final dataset?*

Approximately 140.000 after filtering for movies, and NA's
for genre's and audience ratings.

<br>

*Include a table of variable description/operstionalisation.* 


The main variables that will be examined:

• Movie running time (IV) - primary runtime of the title, in minutes  
• Audience rating (DV) - weighted average of all the individual user ratings  
• Genre (Categorical Moderator) - includes up to three genres associated with the title  
  


## Method

- What methods do you use to answer your research question?

For data preparation, datawrangling principles were administered. Firstly the dataset title.basics.tsv.gz 
was filtered to only include movie titles, thereby excluding other included film-types in the dataset such 
as tv-shows and short-films. Additionally, the dataset was structured in ascending order of release year.  

Next, both datasets were merged, ...


As for the method of analysis, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) with interaction terms will be used.

<br>

- Provide justification for why it is the most suitable. 

MLR is an appropriate analysis method for a continuous IV and DV, allowing examination of interaction
terms for movie genre as a moderator.
